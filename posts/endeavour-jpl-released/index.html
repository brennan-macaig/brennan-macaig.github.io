        <p>Hey Folks!</p>
<p>Happy to announce that Endeavour and JPL are now both available on my GitHub publicly!</p>
<p>Endeavour and JPL are tools that I am happy to contribute to the open source community, and I&rsquo;ll
take some space here in my blog to explain what they do, why I made them, and how they work.</p>
<h3 id="endeavour">

</h3>
<p>Endeavour <em>(the last NASA-made thing to bring humans to space)</em> is a tool which effectively mimics cURL,
writing files to the raw repository format in Nexus. Initially, endeavour was created to replace a tool
written in bash.</p>
<p>At present, endeavour only supports the raw repository format, although I have plans of extending it to
support other repository formats.</p>
<p>Endeavour was designed with a few, very simple goals in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be easy to use in a CI/CD pipeline (GitLab&rsquo;s CI/CD was what was designed for, which is very similar to Travis-CI)</li>
<li>Be secure, handling credentials well and not leaking them to a process table or other location</li>
<li>Easy to use, with minimal arguments to do the right thing</li>
<li>Execute fast</li>
<li>No external dependencies other than Nexus being online</li>
</ul>
<p>With these goals in mind, I&rsquo;m fairly sure endeavour meets them.</p>
<p>Endeavour can upload files and directories, as well as can upload as many files from as many locations in a single command.
This is accomplished entirely with Go&rsquo;s standard library, without any external dependencies in the supply chain to build.</p>
<p>Although, endeavour is not complete - it would certainly appreciate some work! If you&rsquo;d like to contribute to endeavour,
feel free!</p>
<p><strong>Endeavour can be found <a href="https://github.com/brennan-macaig/endeavour/">on my GitHub</a></strong></p>

  </a>
</h3>
<p>JPL <em>(the Jet Propulsion Lab)</em> is a tool I created to build software &ldquo;with rocket speed&rdquo;. JPL is an alternative
to something like Make/Gradle (most similar though to Make). It runs a set of commands in a YAML file line by line, and
just captures their output. It doesn&rsquo;t make crappy assumptions about commands, instead basing actions on their exit codes.</p>
<p>You may be saying &ldquo;jeez, that sounds a lot like bash&rdquo;. It is! Except JPL supports templating, and isn&rsquo;t impossible to read.</p>
<p>JPL files are designed to look very similar to those for GitLab CI/CD / Travis-CI so that people familiar with those tools
can basically use JPL out-of-the-box in a basic manner, and can learn more about templating to use it in a more complex
way.</p>
<p>JPL was created because</p>
<ol>
<li>Gradle requires Java (?!) which sucks</li>
<li>In order to understand Make you need to sacrifice your first-born child and sign a contract with the devil in blood</li>
<li>Bash sucks to maintain</li>
</ol>
<p>JPL can always use more features (modules) to run, as well as needs the following improvements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The environment passed to commands is probably too wide. I&rsquo;d like to model what is passed off of <code>sudo</code>.</li>
<li>JPL should support arbitrary &ldquo;steps&rdquo; as opposed to only <code>build</code> and <code>test</code>. Invoking <code>jpl run</code> should run the
stages in either a user-defined order, or only run <code>build</code> if no order is found and there is a build stage. Otherwise
invoking <code>jpl run &lt;stagename&gt;</code> should simply invoke only that stage.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d like JPL to be able to easily integrate with HashiCorp Vault.</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m very happy to release both endeavour and JPL, and am happy to review any merge requests that you
may submit!</p>
<p>If you end up using JPL/endeavour, I look forward to hearing from you about your experiences!</p>
